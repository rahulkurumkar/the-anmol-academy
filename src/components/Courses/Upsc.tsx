          <h1>UPSC</h1>
          <p>
            There is a dearth of awareness about UPSC as a strong career option,
            not only amongst the rural population but also amongst the well
            educated, urban middle class. When we utter the word ‘career’,
            people, especially anxious parents and their wards think of
            Engineering (with preference attached to software engineering) ,
            Medical, Management, Architecture so on and so forth. We generally
            read in the interviews of successful, meritorious students from 10th
            or 12th Boards that they would like to become engineers, doctors or
            these days – MBAs. However, very few of them as well as their
            parents are aware about UPSC or Union civil services as a robust
            career option, which not only can give name, fame as well as a
            secure, stable and enriching career path but also immense inner
            satisfaction of serving the society in true sense of the term. Union
            Public Service Commission is an autonomous constitutional body which
            recruits personnel for different Union Services (except Armed
            Forces). Civil Service is a crucial institution, which is
            responsible for implementing the laws made by the legislature as
            well as the policies formulated by the government. This is the
            higher class among the public administration, which includes
            domestic as well as foreign affairs. (However, it does not include
            judiciary or Armed forces). The Indian Civil Services are
            categorized as Group A, Group B, Group C and Group D services.
            Through a rigorous examination procedure, UPSC recruits personnel
            for about 24 services. The list is given below:

            The candidates which are selected by the UPSC are recruited by the
            Government of India for these various services depending on their
            rank. The selected candidates are given training of their respective
            services and then they join their service in any of the state/zone
            in India, which is assigned to them.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>Why UPSC is a desirable career option?</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            UPSC has all the ingredients, which are essential to make it a sound
            career option, namely stability of tenure, attractive salary and
            social status. But more than that the powers which are bestowed upon
            the person occupying these posts and the opportunity to utilize
            these powers for the benefit of the ‘Public’ gives it an edge over
            the other career options. Because, here in UPSC, your aim doesn’t
            get confined to ‘private gain’ but you can serve ‘public purpose’
            through your career. This sense of fulfilment is the most important
            thing that makes it a coveted career.
