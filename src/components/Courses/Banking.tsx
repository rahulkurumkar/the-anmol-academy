            <strong>BANKING EXAMS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Banking sector is a huge goldmine of opportunities for graduates
            seeking a secured government job and a good career. Every year over
            fifty thousand vacancies of officer and clerical grade are recruited
            in Public Sector banks through open competitive exams conducted by
            SBI and IBPS. Based on basic aptitude, these exams are relatively
            easy, fast, transparent and are conducted in a time bound manner.
            Basic Mathematics, English, Reasoning, General Awareness and
            Computer Awareness are the core components of the syllabus for these
            exams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Broadly the syllabus and exam pattern of all Aptitude based
            competitive exams in Banking, Insurance, Railway, FCI etc. has
            extensive overlaps and consequently all these exams can be prepared
            for simultaneously. With proper guidance, planning and diligent
            efforts they can be cleared with a preparation of 4-6 months.
          </p>

            <strong>Institute For Banking Personnel Selection:</strong> IBPS is
            an autonomous institution mandated to conduct exams for recruitment
            to officer and clerical grade positions in Public Sector Banks as
            well as some Public Sector Insurance Companies. It started
            functioning as the Personnel Selection Service in 1975 and was later
            transformed in to an autonomous institution in 1984 with the present
            name.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Combined Written Exam(CWE)</strong>: Prior to 2011 IBPS used
            to conduct separate exams for recruitment in all the Public Sector
            Banks. To streamline the entire process, it was decided to have a
            single exam for each category of posts in all the Public Sector
            Banks. Consequently, the system of having a Common Written Exam each
            for the categories of Probationary Officer, Specialist Officer and
            Clerk was started in 2011. Subsequently the common exam for
            recruitment to posts in 56 Regional Rural Bank was started in
            following years. SBI however was not included in these common exams
            in the light of its own recruitment needs and hence separate exams
            are conducted for SBI PO, SO and Clerk.

            <strong>PROBATIONARY OFFICER: </strong>A Probationary Officer is an
            Assistant Manager rank officer in a Public Sector Bank of India. He
            is a generalist officer who can be posted in any vertical of the
            bank. It is the highest point of entry in a Public Sector Bank for
            graduates through an open competitive exam. He serves two years on
            Probation before being confirmed as an Officer in the bank. During
            the Probation itself his pay, perks and facilities are equivalent to
            that of an Assistant Manager. A PO is considered as the Cream of the
            organization and can potentially rise to the rank of the Chairman of
            the Bank.
