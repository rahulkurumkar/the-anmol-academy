Final Structure of SSC came into effect\n            from 1<sup>st</sup> June 1999 when it renamed as Staff Selection\n            Commission.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            &nbsp;SSC conducts many competitive exams such as CGL(Combined\n            Graduate Level Exam), CPO(Central Police Organization),CHSL(Combined\n            Higher Secondary Level Exam), Jen(Junior Engineer),\n            MTS(Multitasking) etc.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The main attraction of SSC is the CGL Exam, because this exam\n            provides many Top Group “B” posts like Inspector in Income Tax\n            Department, Central&nbsp; Excise Department, Customs Department,\n            Narcotics Department, Enforcement Department(ED), Central Vigilance\n            Commission, Department of Post, Sub Inspector in CBI, Sub Inspector\n            in IB, Assistant in Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of\n            Railway, Armed&nbsp; fascinating posts.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When we enter as Inspector in Revenue departments like Income Tax,\n            Central Excise and Customs, we can get promotion to Class ‘A’\n            officer that is ‘IRS’ (Indian Revenue Service) within a stipulated\n            time. These posts are undoubtedly very much popular among the\n            aspirants who are preparing for this exam every year because it\n            makes us feel very proud and our family as well. In many of the\n            Posts there is Uniform also with ‘3’ stars, which makes us feel\n            something special and we get higher social respect.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In these Central Govt.

As an Inspector,\n            we draw around 62,000/- in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chennai,\n            Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmadabad (‘X’ cities), around\n            58,000 in ‘Y’ cities and around 54,000 in ‘Z’ cities.

Because workload is very\n            nominal and classes can also be taken on Weekends i.e. Saturday and\n            Sunday so studies can be continued in a very regular way, so no more\n            hectic schedules in terms of preparation for UPSC or State Services.\n            It is not mandatory to opt Central Secretariat Service for UPSC\n            preparation, one can also prepare while working in other departments\n            also.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The number of vacancies is about 10,000 – 12,000 every year through\n            CGL exam which is no doubt very big in terms of All India Level\n            Exam. That’s why this particular exam is very popular among the\n            students. This number of vacancies may vary year by year.

Job safety: Central government jobs are secure and recession\n            proof. The Indian government is seen as a stable employer, unlike\n            many private sector establishments, where hire and fire work culture\n            is there. Job prospects in public sector are relatively unaffected\n            by the demand and supply forces prevailing in the job market.\n            <br />\n            2. Financial stability: Working in a government job comes with\n            complete financial stability. The government is not expected to\n            default on salary payments that are due to its employees. The\n            payments are made on time and one does not have to worry about the\n            salary not getting credited into the account.\n            <br />\n            3. Salary increments: Pay commissions regularly review the salary\n            structure offered to Central Government workforce. Salaries in\n            public sector go up, whenever the recommendations of a pay\n            commission are implemented. In the recent past, these\n            recommendations have been employee-friendly, thereby making Central\n            Government jobs even more lucrative.\n            <br />\n            4. Timely promotions: Seniority is a crucial factor in Central\n            Government promotion policy. Due importance is given to the time\n            that one has spent in the job. Employees get fairly rewarded on the\n            basis of the experience they possess\n            <br />\n            5. Work-Life balance: Cracking SSC CGL ensures that you will get\n            into a job which offers wonderful work-life balance. Unlike the\n            private sector, wherein performance on the job is of utmost\n            importance, a Central Government job gives you ample time for\n            personal enrichment.\n            <br />\n            6. Equal opportunities: Central Government is an equal opportunity\n            employer in the real sense. It does not discriminate on the basis of\n            caste, creed religion, ethnicity or any other parameter. The\n            recruitments made are seen to be by and large transparent. One has\n            to prove one’s merit in a competitive exam in order to get selected\n            <br />\n            7. Social status: A person employed in Central Government enjoys a\n            dignified standing in society. A lot of candidates attempt SSC CGL\n            as they are not just after a well paying job but after the social\n            esteem associated with the post. For many candidates taking SSC CGL\n            is the first step towards their dream of becoming a gazetted officer\n            some day.\n            <br />\n            8. Career progression: SSC keeps conducting grade-wise departmental\n            competitive exams for existing Central Government staff members.\n            This provides them with ample growth prospects. Superior performance\n            in these exams can set a person on a path of accelerated career\n            progression.\n          </p>\n          <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nexport default class Mpsc extends React.Component {\n  public render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div\n          style={{\n            paddingLeft: \"50px\",\n            paddingRight: \"50px\",\n            margin: \"auto 0\"\n          }}\n        >\n          <h1>MPSC</h1>\n          <p>\n            Even though there is some awareness about MPSC examination among the\n            rural as well as urban population in Maharashtra, not many think of\n            it as a strong career option. Especially in an industrially\n            developed state like Maharashtra, there is availability of other\n            attractive career opportunities such as Engineering (preferably\n            software engineering), Medical, Management, Architecture so on and\n            so forth. Hence the parents as well as students seldom think of MPSC\n            as their very first career option. In addition to this, various\n            misunderstanding about the nature of these exams, suspicions about\n            one’s own abilities, lack of awareness about availability of quality\n            guidance and standard reading material etc further distract the\n            students from taking this career option seriously. However, like\n            UPSC, MPSC is also a robust career option, which not only can give\n            name, fame as well as a secure, stable and enriching career path but\n            also immense inner satisfaction of serving the society in true sense\n            of the term. MPSC has an added advantage for girls as there is 33%\n            reservation for them in these exams. Maharashtra Public Service\n            Commission is an autonomous constitutional body which recruits\n            personnel for civil services in Maharashtra. Civil Service is a\n            crucial institution, which is responsible for implementing the laws\n            made by the legislature as well as the policies formulated by the\n            government. It also contributes to the process of law and policy\n            making. MPSC has all the ingredients, which are essential to make it\n            a sound career option, namely stability of tenure, attractive salary\n            and social status. But more than that the powers which are bestowed\n            upon the person occupying these posts and the opportunity to utilize\n            these powers for the benefit of the ‘Public’ gives it an edge over\n            the other career options. Because, here in MPSC, along with ‘private\n            gain’, ‘public purpose’ also be served through your career. This\n            sense of fulfillment is the most important thing that makes it a\n            coveted career.

One of the major changes is that there won’t\n            be any optional subjects any more even for the Mains. There shall be\n            4 papers of General Studies with different components. Following is\n            the distribution of marks for Mains:\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Only the language papers i.e. Marathi and English are descriptive in\n            nature.

When we utter the word ‘career’,\n            people, especially anxious parents and their wards think of\n            Engineering (with preference attached to software engineering) ,\n            Medical, Management, Architecture so on and so forth. We generally\n            read in the interviews of successful, meritorious students from 10th\n            or 12th Boards that they would like to become engineers, doctors or\n            these days – MBAs. However, very few of them as well as their\n            parents are aware about UPSC or Union civil services as a robust\n            career option, which not only can give name, fame as well as a\n            secure, stable and enriching career path but also immense inner\n            satisfaction of serving the society in true sense of the term. Union\n            Public Service Commission is an autonomous constitutional body which\n            recruits personnel for different Union Services (except Armed\n            Forces).
