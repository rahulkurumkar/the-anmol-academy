        <p>
          WHY UPSC IS A DESIRABLE CAREER OPTION? UPSC has all the ingredients,
          which are essential to make it a sound career option, namely stability
          of tenure, attractive salary and social status. But more than that the
          powers which are bestowed upon the person occupying these posts and
          the opportunity to utilize these powers for the benefit of the
          ‘Public’ gives it an edge over the other career options. Because, here
          in UPSC, your aim doesn’t get confined to ‘private gain’ but you can
          serve ‘public purpose’ through your career. This sense of fulfilment
          is the most important thing that makes it a coveted career
