            <strong>SSC (Staff Selection Commission) EXAM</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            SSC means Staff Selection Commission. It is an Organization
            under&nbsp;<strong>Government of India </strong>to recruit staff for
            various posts in the various{" "}
            <strong>Ministries and Departments </strong>of the&nbsp;Government
            of India&nbsp;and in <strong>Subordinate Offices </strong>i.e.
            <strong> Group ‘B’ &amp; Group ‘C’.&nbsp; </strong>Initially SSC
            termed as Subordinate Service Commission because it conducts exams
            for lower posts than UPSC. Final Structure of SSC came into effect
            from 1<sup>st</sup> June 1999 when it renamed as Staff Selection
            Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;SSC conducts many competitive exams such as CGL(Combined
            Graduate Level Exam), CPO(Central Police Organization),CHSL(Combined
            Higher Secondary Level Exam), Jen(Junior Engineer),
            MTS(Multitasking) etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main attraction of SSC is the CGL Exam, because this exam
            provides many Top Group “B” posts like Inspector in Income Tax
            Department, Central&nbsp; Excise Department, Customs Department,
            Narcotics Department, Enforcement Department(ED), Central Vigilance
            Commission, Department of Post, Sub Inspector in CBI, Sub Inspector
            in IB, Assistant in Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of
            Railway, Armed&nbsp; fascinating posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we enter as Inspector in Revenue departments like Income Tax,
            Central Excise and Customs, we can get promotion to Class ‘A’
            officer that is ‘IRS’ (Indian Revenue Service) within a stipulated
            time. These posts are undoubtedly very much popular among the
            aspirants who are preparing for this exam every year because it
            makes us feel very proud and our family as well. In many of the
            Posts there is Uniform also with ‘3’ stars, which makes us feel
            something special and we get higher social respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these Central Govt. Posts salary is very good. As an Inspector,
            we draw around 62,000/- in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chennai,
            Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmadabad (‘X’ cities), around
            58,000 in ‘Y’ cities and around 54,000 in ‘Z’ cities. So as a
            beginner drawing this much of salary with stability is quite good as
            career prospective.
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone wants to continue his or her studies for UPSC or State
            Services, he or she can continue with this kind of job specially in
            Central Secretariat Service (Delhi). Because workload is very
            nominal and classes can also be taken on Weekends i.e. Saturday and
            Sunday so studies can be continued in a very regular way, so no more
            hectic schedules in terms of preparation for UPSC or State Services.
            It is not mandatory to opt Central Secretariat Service for UPSC
            preparation, one can also prepare while working in other departments
            also.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of vacancies is about 10,000 – 12,000 every year through
            CGL exam which is no doubt very big in terms of All India Level
            Exam. That’s why this particular exam is very popular among the
            students. This number of vacancies may vary year by year. It may
            increase upto 15,000 which depends on different departments and
            their requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, things we need to focus to crack this exam are very simple but
            in a regular way. This CGL exam has 3 tiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tier 1 (Online Mode) : Consists 100 questions in 60 minutes for 200
            marks (English, Math, Reasoning, General Awareness each section
            contains 25 questions)
          </p>
          <p>
            Tier 2 (Online Mode) : Two Papers, 120 minutes each (1<sup>ST</sup>{" "}
            Paper: Maths – 100 questions for 200 marks, 2<sup>nd</sup> Paper:
            English – 200 questions for 200 marks)
          </p>
          <p>
            Tier 3 (Pen &amp; Paper Mode) : Descriptive Paper which contains
            Essay writing and Letter Writing for 100 marks in 60 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Final cutoff is calculated from all the three tiers&nbsp; i.e. Tier
            1+Tier 2+Tier 3 (700 marks).
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in CGL we just need to focus English and Maths. The level is not
            very tough which is very similar to 10<sup>th</sup> standard. But
            the root thing is regular practice. The Notification releases each
            year in the month of February.
          </p>
          <p>
            One more thing if someone is preparing of SSC-CGL, then no need to
            prepare for other exams like CHSL, Jen, CPO etc., because the level
            which we prepare for CGL is more than sufficient for all other
            exams. So, Aim yourself for SSC-CGL and try to get a respectable
            post.

            <strong>WHY SSC?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Job safety: Central government jobs are secure and recession
            proof. The Indian government is seen as a stable employer, unlike
            many private sector establishments, where hire and fire work culture
            is there. Job prospects in public sector are relatively unaffected
            by the demand and supply forces prevailing in the job market.
            <br />
            2. Financial stability: Working in a government job comes with
            complete financial stability. The government is not expected to
            default on salary payments that are due to its employees. The
            payments are made on time and one does not have to worry about the
            salary not getting credited into the account.
            <br />
            3. Salary increments: Pay commissions regularly review the salary
            structure offered to Central Government workforce. Salaries in
            public sector go up, whenever the recommendations of a pay
            commission are implemented. In the recent past, these
            recommendations have been employee-friendly, thereby making Central
            Government jobs even more lucrative.
            <br />
            4. Timely promotions: Seniority is a crucial factor in Central
            Government promotion policy. Due importance is given to the time
            that one has spent in the job. Employees get fairly rewarded on the
            basis of the experience they possess
            <br />
            5. Work-Life balance: Cracking SSC CGL ensures that you will get
            into a job which offers wonderful work-life balance. Unlike the
            private sector, wherein performance on the job is of utmost
            importance, a Central Government job gives you ample time for
            personal enrichment.
            <br />
            6. Equal opportunities: Central Government is an equal opportunity
            employer in the real sense. It does not discriminate on the basis of
            caste, creed religion, ethnicity or any other parameter. The
            recruitments made are seen to be by and large transparent. One has
            to prove one’s merit in a competitive exam in order to get selected
            <br />
            7. Social status: A person employed in Central Government enjoys a
            dignified standing in society. A lot of candidates attempt SSC CGL
            as they are not just after a well paying job but after the social
            esteem associated with the post. For many candidates taking SSC CGL
            is the first step towards their dream of becoming a gazetted officer
            some day.
            <br />
            8. Career progression: SSC keeps conducting grade-wise departmental
            competitive exams for existing Central Government staff members.
            This provides them with ample growth prospects. Superior performance
            in these exams can set a person on a path of accelerated career
            progression.
